# Personal Website

This project is a rework of my original personal website. It simplifies my original website by using CSS3 layout tools (grid and flexbox), better responsive design, and individual web development projects.

## Technologies
- Javascript — I decided to keep my code in vanilla Javascript, but in the spirit of education (and of the assignment), I have also written a jQuery version of my project.
- NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day API

## Approach
I tackled this project first by doing a thorough review/test of my original website. I noted the following major problems:

- Redundant image display — within the Javascript, there was formerly an array of images, but within the HTML the images were also present. This website dynamically creates the images, eliminating the need for the pre-coded HTML images, thus simplifying future image updates.
- The original website had too many categories, including older work. In lieu of this, my portfolio have been updated to only include the most recent projects.
- There were several formatting problems, including but not limited to text that flowed outside of divs on window resize.
- Updated to a more modern style


## Notable Moments
### Victories
- I have been meaning to call the NASA APOD API and have had trouble in the past. Turns out I was just using an invalid key, but I still got it to work this time around nonetheless -- in both JS and jQuery!
### Challenges

## To Do
- Vanilla JS Scroll Animation
- Reveal Animation
- Swipe on Slideshow
- Treehouse API
